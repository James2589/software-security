#Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  
  Artemis Financial is a financial company who wants to build a secure app. The client included government and public users. The major issues that Artemis Financial wanted solved was secure communications.

#What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  
  I did a good job of researching the vulnerabilities to find proper solutions for the issues. It is important to create secure code to protect the company and end users from bad actors. Software security is vital for any company protecting user/employee information, safeguarding company information, and protecting the companies reputation are all reasons to ensure security practices are incorporated into software. 

#What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

  The vulnerability assessment is helpful by giving a list of vulnerabilities to focus your search on. This includes many false positives but is far better than a missed vulnerability.
  
#How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

  Using the vulnerability assessment I was able to increase security by ensure that the software is updated to the newest versions. I was also able to check if the newest versions brought in any new threats that would need to be solved with custom code.

#How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  
  Once I completed my code I would then rerun the vulnerability assessment to ensure no new vulnerabilities were added to the system.

#What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  I used the OWASP vulnderability assesment to find vulnerabilities as as well as the Java manuals to find best practices using specific algorithms.
  
#Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

  From this assignment I would show my implementation of plug ins, specifically the vulnerability assessment. From there I could go into how I would go about asssessing the information provided and improving the security of the code.
